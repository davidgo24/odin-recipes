    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This casserole is the perfect winter dinner! It's gone in seconds in my house. Make sure to use whole-milk ricotta and use more red pepper if you like it hotter. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (12 ounce) box jumbo pasta shells</li>
            <li>Â¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
            <li>1 pound ground sirloin</li>
            <li>1 pound Italian sausage, hot or sweet</li>
            <li>1 small yellow onion, finely chopped</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Set a rack in the center of the oven, about 10 inches from the heat source.            </li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add shells and cook, stirring occasionally, until almost tender, about 7 minutes. Scoop out 1/2 cup cooking water; set aside. Drain pasta in a colander. Return to pot and toss with 1 tablespoon oil. </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat remaining 3 tablespoons oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add sirloin and sausage and cook, undisturbed, until bottom side is lightly browned, about 6 minutes. Stir, and continue to cook, stirring and breaking up meat into smaller pieces with a wooden spoon, until cooked through, about 4 minutes.  </li>
        </ol>
